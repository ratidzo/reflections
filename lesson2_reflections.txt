Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: Staging area is part of a git repository while a working directory is not necessarily a git repository.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: Using git diff --staged to compare the staging area to the most recent commit makes it possible to see the changes before they are commited. In this way, a commit can be made after the change qualifies as logical.
