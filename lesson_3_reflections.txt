Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I want my project backed up to the cloud or when I want other people to contribute to my project.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: To keep git from updating the repo with partial or incomplete changes.
